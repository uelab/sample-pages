# User Empowerment Lab Website

The User Empowerment Lab is a research lab at the University of Washington directed by Professor Alexis Hiniker.  Founded in 2017, the User Empowerment Lab focuses on understanding people's frustrations with the online systems they use, and creating designs for systems that support more meaningful human experiences.
