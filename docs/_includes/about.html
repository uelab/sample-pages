        <p>Have you ever found yourself checking your phone without knowing why? 
            Or losing your cool during an online argument? 
            If so, you're not alone, and these habits are no accident. 
            Online products are designed to draw people back as often as possible, keep them hooked for as long as possible, and encourage them to disclose information along the way. 
            But designs to maximize engagement and information disclosure are not always aligned with human wellbeing. </p>
            
        <p>The <b>User Empowerment Lab</b> examines peopleâ€™s frustrations with the systems they use, including: distraction, compulsion, outrage, information overload, lack of privacy, and an inability to connect with others. And we create proof-of-concept systems that support more meaningful human experiences.</p>
